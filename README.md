# Cave Generator using C++ & SFML
## It is made using Marching Squares Algorithm but it can also be procedurally generated using Perlin Noise or Open Simplex Noise Fields

## Installing dependencies

    sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev dialog -y
    
## Command to compile

    make compile
    
## Command to run

    ./cave
### Press <kbd>S</kbd> key to save a frame
## The idea was to extnd the edges and form an edge list and apply 2D ray casting within the caves
## I guess I'll just make a seperate project for that one
